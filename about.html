    <h2>History Of Mercedes-Benz</h2>
    <hr>
    <div class="container">

      <p>Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770 model, a car that was notably popular throughout Germany's Nazi period. Adolf Hitler was known to have driven in a model of this car during his time in power, with modified custom bulletproof windshields.[14] Most of the currently surviving 770 models were sold at auctions to private buyers. One of the cars is currently on display at the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.[15]

        From 1937 onward, Daimler Benz focused increasingly on military products such as the LG3000 lorry and the DB600 and the DB601 aero engines. To build the latter, in 1936, it built a factory hidden in the forest at Genshagen around 10 km south of Berlin. By 1942, the company had mostly stopped producing cars, and was now devoted to war production. According to its statement, in 1944, almost half of its 63,610 employees were forced labourers, prisoners of war, or concentration-camp detainees.[16] Another source quotes this figure at 46,000. The company later paid $12 million in reparations to the labourers' families</p>

      <p>In 1958, the two companies began a partnership to sell their cars in the United States with Studebaker. A few American-based Daimler Benz dealerships were converted into Mercedes-Benz dealerships when Daimler's non-Mercedes-partnered company closed in 1966.

        Over the decades, Mercedes-Benz has introduced many electronic and mechanical innovations and safety features that later became common.[18] Currently, Mercedes-Benz is one of the best-known and longest-standing automotive brands in the world. The pontiff's Popemobile has often been sourced from Mercedes-Benz.[15]
        
        In November 2019, Daimler AG announced that Mercedes-Benz, until that point a company marque, would be spun off into a separate, wholly owned subsidiary called Mercedes-Benz AG. The new subsidiary would manage the Mercedes-Benz car and van business. Mercedes-Benz-badged trucks and buses would be part of the Daimler Truck AG subsidiary.[1]
        
        For information relating to the three-pointed star symbol of the brand, see under the title Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft, including the merger into Daimler-Benz.

      <br>
      <p >Mercedes-AMG became a majority-owned division of Mercedes-Benz in 1999.[23] The company was integrated into DaimlerChrysler in 1999,[24] and became Mercedes-Benz AMG on 1 January 1999.</p>

      <br>
      <p >Daimler's ultraluxury Maybach brand was under the Mercedes-Benz Cars division until December 2012, when production was stopped due to decreased sales.[26] It now exists under the Mercedes-Maybach name, with the models being luxury-focused, enhanced models of Mercedes-Benz cars, such as the 2016 Mercedes-Maybach S600.[27] The Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 SUV debuted in November 2019</p>

        The two companies which were merged to form the Mercedes-Benz brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success in the new sport of motor racing throughout their separate histories. A single Benz competed in the world's first motor race, the 1894 Paris–Rouen, where Émile Roger finished 14th in 10 hours 1 minute. Throughout its long history, the company has been involved in a range of motorsport activities, including sports car racing and rallying. On several occasions, Mercedes-Benz has withdrawn completely from motorsport for a significant period, notably in the late 1930s, and after the 1955 Le Mans disaster, where a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR rammed another car (an Austin-Healey), took off into the stands.
